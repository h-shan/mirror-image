I hope you feel better soon.
When you want to give up, tell yourself you will hold on for just one more day, hour, minuteâ€”whatever you can manage.
You are important to me. Your life is important to me.
I hope things get better.
Your life is important to me. You are important to me.
You can get through this.
You're a gift to everyone to meet.
I know that if you ever make a mistake, you fix it.
Everything seems brighter when you are around.
You are enough.
I'm not going to leave you or abandon you.
You won't drive me away.
There is hope.
