Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done!Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm and Mrs. Turnbull of Australia to the @WhiteHouse!

üá∫üá∏üá¶üá∫Press Conference: https://t.co/rKokJGRsgu https://t.co/PkJUw8x9jbOur nation‚Äôs motto is IN GOD WE TRUST. This week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. We will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of Billy Graham! #CPAC2018 https://t.co/5GDh7JonkvWe salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance, and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem. #CPAC2018 https://t.co/qGKW2xGjP0After years of rebuilding OTHER nations, we are finally rebuilding OUR nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride! #CPAC2018 https://t.co/rD9oTU8iexFor those of you who are still interested, the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them!My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country.CPAC Today!MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water. El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!‚ÄúSchool shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question.‚Äù @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN, Fake News. That‚Äôs why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse.Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials.

There is nothing more important than protecting our children. They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver! https://t.co/WhC2AxgWXOOn behalf of an entire Nation, CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S. Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD! #GoTeamUSA #Olympics https://t.co/3cUZwLVGuaWill be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety.  Next week it will be with our Nation‚Äôs Governors. It‚Äôs been many years of all talk, no action. We‚Äôll get it done!What many people don‚Äôt understand, or don‚Äôt want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!....If a potential ‚Äúsicko shooter‚Äù knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won‚Äôt go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won‚Äôt work!....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A ‚Äúgun free‚Äù school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!I never said ‚Äúgive teachers guns‚Äù like was stated on Fake News @CNN &amp; @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‚Äúconcealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able toI will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!

Full Listening Session: https://t.co/x5VenyQX5p https://t.co/CAPfX5odIp.@FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham. Our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry. https://t.co/e1697tcyaIYesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the Medal of Valor. #AmericanHeroes https://t.co/em0wBbvy5PQuestion: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren‚Äôt they the subject of the investigation? Why didn‚Äôt Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren‚Äôt Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!So true, thank you! https://t.co/9TTXlfokYzBad ratings @CNN &amp; @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. "This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." https://t.co/w9aw68UwOj....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn‚Äôt @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn‚Äôt fit the Mainstream Media narrative.A woman I don‚Äôt know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new ‚Äúpushed‚Äù Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don‚Äôt let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You‚Äôve come a long way Matt!Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R‚Äôs want to fix!....The President Obama quote just before election. That‚Äôs because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúrock the boat.‚Äù When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.‚ÄúThere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America‚Äôs elections, there‚Äôs no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I‚Äôd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.‚Äù .....Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!‚ÄúThe Faith of Donald Trump,‚Äù a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read. Enjoy!The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn‚Äôt he do something about Russian meddling?Have a great, but very reflective, President‚Äôs Day!Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromoGreat Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN. https://t.co/rYsv90cnvsIf it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!RT @mike_pence: Big night. Largest-ever Dallas County GOP Reagan Day Dinner. As I told the crowd, under President @realDonaldTrump: Promise‚Ä¶Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn‚Äôt I a great candidate?I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said ‚Äúit may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.‚Äù The Russian ‚Äúhoax‚Äù was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!Finally, Liddle‚Äô Adam Schiff, the leakin‚Äô monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!Just like they don‚Äôt want to solve the DACA problem, why didn‚Äôt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn‚Äôt want to, and now they just talk!‚ÄúI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.‚Äù
Rob Goldman
Vice President of Facebook Ads https://t.co/A5ft7cGJkEThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJFunny how the Fake News Media doesn‚Äôt want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn‚Äôt know!Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: ‚ÄúThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.‚ÄúCharges Deal Don A Big Win,‚Äù written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that ‚Äúthe Russians had no impact on the election results.‚Äù There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. ‚ÄúShe lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.‚ÄùMelania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida. Will never forget them, or the evening!Our entire Nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in Parkland, FL. To teachers, law enforcement, first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage! https://t.co/3yJsrebZMG https://t.co/ti791dENTyRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida: https://t.co/RTQWAKiSnR https://t.co/Nhs32bm5zB...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill!The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be ‚Äúthe end of immigration enforcement in America.‚Äù It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn‚Äôt build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...RT @SpoxDHS: Schumer-Rounds-Collins destroys the ability of @DHSgov to enforce immigration laws, creating a mass amnesty for over 10 millio‚Ä¶In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. https://t.co/bu140nscez https://t.co/OoTXMCSexBWhile the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.Today, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America‚Äôs depleted infrastructure. https://t.co/8ByoQJsjTT https://t.co/BVBRDvHfcCAs we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation: https://t.co/Sw1iGIJgWV https://t.co/Nx0AEKZy5pNegotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!Thank you to Sue Kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends.

After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp; smart, loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn‚Äôt want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGAMy Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/xV1lgfhjBUMy thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD. https://t.co/AoingY77KyRepublicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!....agencies, not just the FBI &amp; DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don‚Äôt believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).‚Äù Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews‚ÄúMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he‚Äôs been victimized. He‚Äôs been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything ‚Äî and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a ‚Äúpaper trail‚Äù on a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/yukxm48x9XAs long as we open our eyes to God‚Äôs grace - and open our hearts to God‚Äôs love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/1cwxs3l0uKI will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm.

Watch here: https://t.co/VPMTnko7Ik https://t.co/4OaXXuj9VaWe need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system.  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5NPolling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery.

March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that‚Äôs why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working.

Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!This memo totally vindicates ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain ‚Äúsacred cows.‚Äù Other Trump polls are way up also.

My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you!Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?  Blaming Samsung!Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: ‚ÄúTrump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.‚Äù Thank you for your honesty Jim!Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!End the Democrats Obstruction! https://t.co/tzBXilvW1bDemocrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don‚Äôt want to do it but are powerless!The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an ‚ÄúA‚Äù-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.‚Äôs!RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can‚Äôt let that hap‚Ä¶RT @FoxNews: .@EricTrump: "My father was elected for one reason, and that's because he actually believes in putting America first, which is‚Ä¶RT @FoxNews: .@KellyannePolls: "Since @POTUS took office, 863,000 new jobs were filled by women.

The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our danger‚Ä¶Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, &amp; ISIS, Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can‚Äôt let that happen!#AMERICA FIRST!For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans!This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdownDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!Today, I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life! You are living witnesses of this year‚Äôs March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives. https://t.co/DMST4qhDmp‚ÄúShutting down the government is a very serious thing. People die, accidents happen.
